# Swim Frontend

React Frontend to bridge assets and interact with Swim liquidity pools.

## Setup

### Basic Installation

You will need Node.js <15 and Yarn.

Run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

Set required environmental variables:

```sh
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

Run `yarn start` to run the app in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Editor/IDE

We support [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/), which provides plugins for all major editors and IDEs. This will ensure consistency for basic coding styles such as indentation and line breaks. See [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) for details.

We use ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting. Itâ€™s a good idea to set up formatting on save in your editor/IDE.

## Linting

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn format` and `yarn format:fix`

Runs `prettier` on all `.{ts,tsx}` files in the `src` directory.

#### `yarn lint` and `yarn lint:fix`

Lints all `.{ts,tsx}` files in the `src` directory, with or without the `--fix` option.

## Localnet/Teamnet Setup

By default, you only have access to Mainnet. For development, you'll likely want to setup a development blockchain environment. There are several options for this, (A) is recommended.

To view more networks in the environment switcher in the upper right corner of the UI, visit [http://localhost:3000/set-custom-ip?ip=159.223.16.33](http://localhost:3000/set-custom-ip?ip=159.223.16.33).

### (A) Connect to our shared Wormhole setup

There is a Digital Ocean machine running an instance of each blockchain in additon to a copy of the Wormhole Guardians.

1. Ask one of the frontend devs to add your SSH key to the development server
1. Add `src/keys/wallet-accounts/6sbzC1eH4FTujJXWj51eQe25cYvr4xfXbJ1vAj7j2k5J.json` to your Solana web wallet (e.g. Phantom)
1. Add `src/keys/wallet-accounts/0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1.txt` to your Ethereum web wallet (e.g. MetaMask)
1. Add Ethereum Localnet to your Metamask

    RPC URL: http://159.223.16.33:8545

    Chain ID: 1337

    Currency Symbol: ETH

1. Add BNB Chain Localnet to your MetaMask

    RPC URL: http://159.223.16.33:8546

    Chain ID: 1397

    Currency Symbol: BNB

1. `yarn start` and visit http://localhost:3000/set-custom-ip?ip=159.223.16.33 to set your custom localnet IP
1. On http://localhost:3000/swap, choose `CustomLocalnet` as your network
1. Connect your wallets, should see non-zero balances

#### Troubleshoot

If the environment stops working, follow the steps below

1. Add the config below to your `~/.ssh/config` file (with your own key file)

    ```ssh-config
    Host wormhole-v2-proxy
      Hostname 159.223.16.33
      User wormhole
      PreferredAuthentications publickey
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_ssh_key # ðŸ‘ˆ Use your own key file here
      LogLevel quiet
      LocalForward 7070 127.0.0.1:7070
      LocalForward 7071 127.0.0.1:7071
      LocalForward 8545 127.0.0.1:8545
      LocalForward 8546 127.0.0.1:8546
      LocalForward 8899 127.0.0.1:8899
      LocalForward 8900 127.0.0.1:8900

    Host wormhole-v2
      Hostname 165.227.133.217
      User wormhole

      LocalForward 41841 127.0.0.1:41841
    ```

1. Run `ssh wormhole-v2`

    This will give you a shell and all the relevant ports will be forwarded to the development server. If you donâ€™t need a shell you can just run `ssh -N wormhole-v2`.

1. [Restarting the chains](http://localhost:10350/overview) and following the steps in [DEV_SETUP](/docs/DEV_SETUP.md#setting-up-tokens-and-pools).

Details about contract addresses can be found in the various files in `src/config`.

### (B) Basic local Solana-only pools setup

1. Add keys/6sbzC1eH4FTujJXWj51eQe25cYvr4xfXbJ1vAj7j2k5J.json to your web wallet (eg sollet.io)
1. Start a local cluster: `solana-test-validator`
1. Run setup script `./scripts/setup_solana_dev.sh`
1. Build Swim contract locally
1. Deploy Swim contract: `./scripts/deploy_swim.sh`
1. Start UI `yarn start`
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/test
1. Init pool (UI)

### (C) Setup local Wormhole environment from scratch

1. Checkout branch `wormat-v2` of Wormat's Wormhole fork: https://github.com/swim-io/wormhole/tree/wormat-v2
1. Follow the instructions in `DEVELOP.md` for prerequisites etc
1. `tilt up` in the root directory of the Wormhole repo
1. Visit http://localhost:10350 for an overview
1. Once `solana-devnet` is ready, run `./scripts/setup_solana_dev.sh`
1. Start UI `yarn start`
1. Visit http://localhost:3000/test
1. Connect wallets and click "Set up Wormhole tokens" button
1. Start Wormhole Bridge UI: from Wormhole root `cd bridge_ui && npm install && npm start`
1. Assuming the Bridge UI is running on port 3001, visit http://localhost:3001
1. Connect wallets and find the Ethereum addresses for the 4 wrapped SPL tokens
1. Update the addresses in the localnet config in `src/constants/config.ts`
1. Wait for the UI to rebuild
