    "# Purpose of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains/documents the (deriviation of) the math used in Swim's pool contract, i.e. how swaps, adds, removes, and their associated fees are calculated. It does not deal with any issues that are specific to implementing this math on the Solana blockchain and it's (at the time of writing) rather limited datatypes for this sort of math. The goal of this notebook is to illuminate the mathematics and rationales that gave rise to the pool contract's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the notebook deals with pool operations in the absence of fees, which are subsequently included in the second part.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic Invariants\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement an AMM (automated market maker), a formula is required that defines the exchange rate between the tokens of the liquidity pool at different liquidity levels (= token balances of the pool). Essentially, such a formula defines what liquidity levels are to be considered equivalent, which then in turn defines how many tokens of some type a user has to transfer to the pool in order to receive a certain amount of tokens of some other type (we call this operation a swap).\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, assume a pool with $n$ different tokens with balances $x_i, i = 1, \\ldots , n$ (we're mostly sticking to the notation of the original [curve whitepaper](https://curve.fi/files/stableswap-paper.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider the constant **sum** invariant (where $D$ can be considered the depth of the pool):\n",
    "$$ I_\\Sigma := \\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = D \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The constant sum invariant essentially says: All tokens are always equally valuable, regardless of their relative abundance within the liquidity pool. Hence each token can always be swapped at a 1:1 ratio with any other token in the pool. So a pool can e.g. be taken from $(1,1)$ to $(0.5, 1.5)$, i.e. one needs to send 0.5 of the second token to receive 0.5 of the first.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that there is an equal number of all tokens in the pool, i.e. $\\forall i,j: x_i = x_j$ (we also call such a pool in equilibrium) then $x_i = \\frac{D}{n}$ and hence if we were to apply the constant **product** invariant instead, we'd get:\n",
    "$$ I_\\Pi := \\left[ \\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\left( \\frac{D}{n} \\right)^n \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(So instead of keeping the sum of the token balances invariant under swaps and hence treating every token as if they are equally valuable at all times, the constant product invariant holds the product constant thus to receive half the balance of one type of token in the pool, you have to send double the amount of the other token, i.e. to take 0.5 of the first token for a pool with balances $(1,1)$, you actually have to send $1$ full token of second type (unlike $0.5$ as for the constant sum).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have two invariants $I_\\Sigma$ and $I_\\Pi$, any [convex combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination) of the two will yield a new invariant that lies between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_\\lambda := \\lambda I_\\Sigma + (1 - \\lambda) I_\\Pi \\quad , \\lambda \\in (0,1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can divide both sides of $I_\\lambda$ by $1-\\lambda$ and define $\\kappa = \\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}$ to get an alternative form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_\\kappa := \\kappa I_\\Sigma + I_\\Pi \\quad , \\kappa \\in (0, \\infty) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, choosing $\\kappa$ (or $\\lambda$) independent of $D$ is suboptimal because it leads to our interpolation not being scale-free: If we consider a pool with $n$ tokens that's maximally out of balance, i.e. $\\forall i > 1: x_i = 0$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_1 = D + \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\left( \\frac{D}{n} \\right)^n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is not linear in $D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, this problem is easily rectified by choosing $\\chi := \\kappa D^{n-1}$, giving rise to our scale-free invariant $I_\\chi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_\\chi := \\chi I_\\Sigma + I_\\Pi $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_\\chi = \\left[ \\chi \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\chi D + \\left( \\frac{D}{n} \\right)^n \\right] $$\n",

    "\n",
    "The Curve whitepaper constructs $I_\\chi$, observes, just as we did, that it intersects the axes (in their words: \"However, it wouldn't support prices going far from the ideal price 1.0.\") but then takes a different route to achieve the desired divergence along the axes than we have with our Radial Distance Invariant $I_\\theta$ by instead making $\\chi$ vary based on the token balances in the pool (i.e. turning $\\chi$ into a function $\\chi(\\overrightarrow{x}), \\overrightarrow{x} = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$) which can take any positive value but tends towards 0 as the pool disequilibrates, hence pushing the overall invariant towards the constant product invariant $I_\\Pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi(\\overrightarrow{x}) = A \\cdot \\mathrm{Decay}(\\overrightarrow{x}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ is the amplification factor which takes on the role of leverage (with larger $A$ pushing the pool invariant towards $I_\\Sigma$ and hence reducing slippage on swaps, while $A=0$ takes us all the way back to $I_\\Pi$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand $\\mathrm{Decay}$ we first consider the ratio $\\rho_i = \\frac{x_i}{D/n}$, which can be thought of as a normalized version of $x_i$ that specifies the token's relative abundance in the pool. A pool in equilibrium yields $\\rho_i = 1$ for all its tokens, but as the pool disequilibrates, some token balances have to decrease while others increase and hence some $\\rho_i$ will have to go down as other $\\rho_j$ rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we were to use the constant product formula, $\\rho_j$ would rise exactly enough so that the product of $\\rho_i$ and $\\rho_j$ remains constant. For example, in a pool with $x_1 = 2, x_2 = 2$ (and hence $\\rho_1 = \\rho_2 = 1$) one could buy one token of the first type for two tokens of the second type yielding $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 4$ (and hence $\\rho_1 = \\frac{1}{2}, \\rho_2 = 2$). If we consider the same pool but consider the constant sum formula however, we could trade 1 token of the first kind for 1 token of the second kind yielding token balances of $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 3$ and consequently $\\rho_1 = \\frac{1}{2}, \\rho_2 = \\frac{3}{2}$ for a product of $\\frac{3}{4} < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, since $I_\\chi$ always lies somewhere between $I_\\Sigma$ and $I_\\Pi$, $\\prod_i \\rho_i$ starts off at $1$ when the pool is in equilibrium, decreases monotonically as token balances drift out of balance, and tends towards $0$ as the relative abundance of even one token tends towards $0$. Therefore $\\prod_i \\rho_i$ is a valid choice for $\\mathrm{Decay}(\\overrightarrow{x})$ and in fact the one used by Curve:\n",

    "The following graph visualizes $\\mathrm{Decay}$ for a pool with $n$ tokens where one token's $\\rho_i = 1/x$ while the surplus is spread evenly among the other tokens. In fact, the following graph constitutes a lower bound because it actually uses a constant sum invariant, so with the actual stableswap invariant the decay would be even slower (i.e. longer bars):"

    "* Remove (liquidity) - remove token balances $\\mathbf{a}$ from the pool in exchange for burning LP tokens\n",
    "    * uniform - burns fixed amount of LP tokens for a proportional remove\n",
    "    * exact burn - burns fixed amount of LP tokens in exchange for one of the pool tokens\n",
    "    * exact output - burns variable amount of LP tokens to receive fixed output balances\n",
    "* Swap - swap token balances $(a_k)_{k \\in I}$ for $a_j$ (where $I \\subset \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $j \\notin I$)\n",
    "    * exact input - (n-1):1 where input balances are fixed\n",
    "    * exact output - 1:(n-1) where output balances are fixed\n",

    "## Ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "Desiderata for pool fee math (and just pool operations in general) in approximate order of importance:\n",
    "1. pure liquidity provision (i.e. balanced adds and removes) shouldn't incur any fees\n",
    "2. pushing the pool back into equilibrium shouldn't be disincentivized\n",
    "3. fee math should be reasonably intuitive to understand (e.g. by making a swap = add + remove)\n",
    "4. if possible, splitting operations should yield the same result as doing it all at once\n",
    "5. operations should act like a fiduciary of the operator (e.g. there shouldn't be ways to get better results by breaking up/mixing operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, there would be only 2 primitives:\n",
    "1. proportional add/remove (no fee)\n",
    "2. swap (percentage fee)\n",
    "... and all other operations (disproportional adds/removes, exact input/exact output ops, ...) would be composed from those primitives only or implemented in a way that's consistent with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, due to the non-linear nature of the invariant and the (computational) constraints of the on-chain environment, only a handful of these desiderata are properly satisfiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to perfectly implement an imbalanced add, one would have to figure out how to distribute the imbalance in a way as to get even proportions (taking fees and the intermediate token proprotion changes in the pool into account). Even worse, to do it in the most profitable (fiduciary) manner possible (to satisfy desideratum 5.) it would have to be implemented in a continuous, self-constistent way so that the user is partially reimburst for the fees they are paying as every infintesimal add increases their own stake in the liquidity of the pool (and hence their claim to a fraction of the generated fees). So overall, this would give rise to a system of non-linear differential equations which would almost certainly be sufficiently well-behaved to solve with reasonable (computational) effort off-chain but that are a complete non-starter on-chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar vein, one problem (among several) of implementing swap = add + remove is that it makes fees harder to understand because you can't just divide the intended swap fee by 2 and apply it to the add and remove because applying half the fee twice does not equal applying the full fee once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actual\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual implementation sacrifices consistency between add+remove and swap, swap exact input and swap exact output, as well as split vs. combined operations by taking a more approximative route instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level overview is: For swaps, fees are taken as a percentage of the input token amount(s), while adds and removes take the same fee percentage from amounts that exceed the amounts of a balanced add/remove that would add the same amount of tokens in total. Fees to liquidity providers are issued in terms of increased pool balances per LP token (LP token appreciation) while governance fees are issed by minting new LP tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correctly account for LP appreciation, governance fee LP tokens are issued as follows: Assume a pool operation creates fees to the tune of $d$ depth (where $d = D_{\\mathtt{new}} - D_{\\mathtt{old}}$), then $d$ is first split into $d = d_{\\mathtt{lp}} + d_{\\mathtt{gov}}$ according to the respective percentage fees (3 and 1 bips respectively at the time of writing), and then $\\mathtt{LP_{gov}} = \\mathtt{LpSupply_{old}} \\cdot \\frac{d_{\\mathtt{gov}}}{D_{\\mathtt{new}} - d_{\\mathtt{gov}}}$ governance LP tokens are minted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each pool operation requires running Newton's method exactly thrice and the first instance is always calculating the current pool depth using the stored depth of the previous operation as its initial guess (and is either exact unless the amp factor is currently ramping up or down). This ensures that pool operations can stay within Solana's rather tight compute budget for a sufficiently wide range of pool balances and amp factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact input swaps follow these steps ($x_j$ being the requested output token):\n",
    "1. determine pool depth $D_\\mathtt{old}$ using the invariant given current pool balances $x_i$ and amp factor $A$\n",
    "2. subtract fee percentage from input amounts $\\mathbf{a}=(a_k)_{k \\in I}$ (with $I$ and $j$ as above) and add the remainder to pool balances $x_i$\n",
    "3. use the invariant to determine the new balance of $x_j$ holding pool depth constant at $D_\\mathtt{old}$\n",
    "4. the difference between the original balance $x_{j,\\mathtt{old}}$ and the new balance $x_{j,\\mathtt{new}}$ constitutes the output amount $a_j = x_{j,\\mathtt{old}} - x_{j,\\mathtt{new}}$\n",
    "5. calculate the new depth of the pool $D_\\mathtt{new}$\n",
    "6. split the depth increase $d = D_\\mathtt{new} - D_\\mathtt{old}$ proportionally between liquidity providers and governance as fees as described above\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the marginal price of a token decreases as more of it is being added to the pool and because fees are taken \"from the top\", an $f \\%$ fee on input amounts $(a_i)$ translates into a lower fee than $f \\%$ in terms of added depth. This makes combining swaps more fee efficient than splitting them (i.e. swapping $\\mathbf{a}$ all at once is more profitable than e.g. $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{a}$ twice).\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact output swaps follow a very similar procedure overall ($x_j$ being the required input token) - steps 1, 3, 5, and 6 are identical, only 2 and 4 are different:\n",
    "2. subtract output amounts $(a_k)_{k \\in I}$ from pool balances $x_i$\n",
    "4. the difference between the new balance $x_{j,\\mathtt{new}}$ and the original balance $x_{j,\\mathtt{old}}$ constitutes the required input amount $\\hat{a}_j = x_{j,\\mathtt{new}} - x_{j,\\mathtt{old}}$ without fees and hence $a_j = \\hat{a}_j \\frac{1}{1-f}$ is the required input amount including fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "($\\frac{1}{1-f}$ because taking e.g. $50 \\%$ of an input amount means you have to slap on an additional $100 \\%$ to the amount without fees.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proportional Add/Remove\n",
    "\n",
    "Proportional adds and removes are entirely straight-forward. They incur no fee and simply provide/burn the number of LP tokens corresponding to the depth increase/decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imbalanced Add\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced adds follow these steps ($i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$):\n",
    "1. determine pool depth $D_\\mathtt{old}$ using the invariant given current pool balances $x_{i,\\mathtt{old}}$ and amp factor $A$\n",
    "2. add input amounts $a_i$ to pool balances $x_{i,\\mathtt{old}}$ to get $x_{i,\\mathtt{new}} = x_{i,\\mathtt{old}} + a_i$\n",
    "3. calculate the depth of the pool $D_\\mathtt{new}$ given $x_{i,\\mathtt{new}}$\n",
    "4. calculate the scale factor $s = \\sum x_{i,\\mathtt{new}} \\ / \\  \\sum x_{i,\\mathtt{old}}$ - calculating the scale factor this way instead of using e.g. the depth increase ensures that splitting adds into a balanced and an imbalanced add gives the same result as doing one big add at once\n",
    "5. calculate the scaled balances $x_{i,\\mathtt{scaled}} = s \\cdot x_{i,\\mathtt{old}}$\n",
    "6. calculate the taxbase $t_i = \\max(x_{i,\\mathtt{new}} - x_{i,\\mathtt{scaled}}, 0)$ - so the taxbase is the portion of the added amounts that exceed the scaled balances and are hence \"taxed\" like a swap\n",
    "7. calculate and subtract fee amounts $a_{i,\\mathtt{fee}} = f \\cdot t_i$ from pool balances to arrive at fee balances $x_{i,\\mathtt{fee}} = x_{i,\\mathtt{new}} - a_{i,\\mathtt{fee}}$\n",
    "8. finally, calculate the depth of the pool one final time for $D_\\mathtt{fee}$ given $x_{i,\\mathtt{fee}}$\n",
    "9. mint $\\mathtt{LpSupply} \\cdot \\frac{D_\\mathtt{fee} - D_\\mathtt{old}}{D_\\mathtt{old}}$ LP tokens to the user\n",
    "10. split the depth increase $d = D_\\mathtt{new} - D_\\mathtt{fee}$ proportionally between liquidity providers and governance as fees as described above (accounting for the increased LP supply that was just allocated to the user!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $x_{i,\\mathtt{old}} \\leq x_{i,\\mathtt{fee}} \\leq x_{i,\\mathtt{new}}$ it follows that $D_\\mathtt{old} \\leq D_\\mathtt{fee} \\leq D_\\mathtt{new}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 10 entails that users adding liquidity to the pool already receive a portion of the fees that their add created, as if they already were liquidity providers to the pool at the time of their add. This is in line with the \"fiduciary desideratum\", otherwise users would be incentivized to break up their add into smaller adds to collect fees on their own, subsequent adds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imbalanced Remove\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to exact input vs exact output swaps, add and removed follow a very similar procedure, where most additions instead turn into subtractions, etc. There are some important difference and inconsistencies though:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because fees are slapped on top of the amounts that are to be removed (again, according to size of their imbalance based on the same scale factor calculation as above), the order of pool depths changes where $D_\\mathtt{fee} \\leq D_\\mathtt{new} \\leq D_\\mathtt{old}$, i.e. $D_\\mathtt{fee}$ is no longer sandwiched between between $D_\\mathtt{old}$ and $D_\\mathtt{new}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding fees on top of removed amounts creates three additional problems:\n",
    "1. Removes are in a sense more expensive than adds, because for an add, fees are taken \"from the top\" (marginal prices decrease as token balances increase), while for a remove fees are added \"on the bottom\" (marginal prices increase as token balances decrease)\n",
    "2. Due to the previous point, a situation can arise where, due to fees, an imbalanced remove becomes impossible: Consider a pool with a total fee of 50 \\%, i.e. $f = 0.5$ and pool balances $x_i = 100$. If one tries to remove 90 tokens of a single balance, a fee of 50 \\% on inputs entails a fee of 100 \\% on outputs (one has to add 2, to get out 1, hence, to remove 1, one has to add 2! - again harkening back to $\\frac{1}{1-f}$). Thus one would have to add an amount that allows one to withdraw $90 + a_{i,\\mathtt{fee}}$ tokens from the pool, where $a_{i,\\mathtt{fee}}$ can easily exceed 10! This is of course impossible since there are only 100 tokens of type $i$ in the pool to begin with. In fact, due to the stable swap invariant, even if we landed on exactly 100 tokens, this would still be impossible. Overall, given small fee percentages and self-interested agents (who could at that point just withdraw most of the liquidity from the pool using a balanced remove) this is not really an issue in practice.\n",
    "3. Since were \"slapping on\" additional fee amounts to output amounts that exceed the scaled balances, we'd have to recalculate the scaled balances with each extra amount that's tacked on until this process converges (which is the case after $n-1$ steps at the latest) to be fully consistent with adds. Since this has next to no relevance in pratice and only further complicates the code (and further eats into the compute budget, even if only maginally), this caveat is ignored in the actual implementation.\n",
